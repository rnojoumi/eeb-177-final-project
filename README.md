#EEB final project 
**Roxana Nojoumi
from these data, I can find the diversity of different unique species and plot diversity through time.
Also I can focus on one specie and plot the occurrence of it, which will help find the extinction time and rates. 
From these results, I can compare the data for species from the same genus or family and find any possible similarity or difference. 
The body size of different species can also help find any possible relation between body size and speciation of Family Equidae.
