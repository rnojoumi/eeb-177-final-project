    "55 million years phylogeny of family Equidae shows the macroevolutionary histry of this family. Interpretation of fossil records suggests a diversity in the extinct forms. The measured length of fossils can vary from 6 to 500 in centimeters. Equidae is a family of odd-toed ungulate mammals of horses and horse-like animals. It is sometimes known as the horse family. By 55 million years ago, the first members of the horse family, the dog-sized Hyracotherium, were scampering through the forests that covered North America. For more than half their history, most horses remained small, forest browsers. But changing climate conditions allowed grasslands to expand, and about 20 million years ago, many new species rapidly evolved. Some--but not all--became larger and had the familiar hooves and grazing diets that we associate with horses today. Only these species survived to the present, but in the past, small and large species lived side by side."
